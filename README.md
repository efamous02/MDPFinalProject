This is my Final Project for: Mobile Device Programming Using swift. I will be using this repository to track progress and display results
  The final project is to create an app from start to finish in four weeks. There is no direction on content or topic. 
  It ends with a presentation to the class as well as weekly sprints reporting to my teacher as a "user"
